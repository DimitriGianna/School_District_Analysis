# School_District_Analysis

Student data from a CSV file was imported into Jupyter Notebook and a series of analyses was performed on it. To start, the data was cleaned by removing null and duplicate values while certain values were reformatted. Next, a summary for the dataframe was produced and certain statistics for student grades were analyzed. Finally, comparison analyses were performed between the budgets of public schools and charter schools, the population of each school in the district, and the average math scores of each grade between public and charter schools. It was determined that the average budget for public schools was greater than that of charter schools and that the average math scores of students in charter schools in Grades 9, 10 and 11 exceeded those for public schools. To further analyze these data, I would perform a comparison analysis of the reading scores by grade of each type of school to see how they compare to the math scores before another series of tests to see how student grades to determine what effect, if any, school type and school budget have on student performance.
